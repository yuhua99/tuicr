> [!TIP]
> Pronounced "tweaker".

## What it does

- GitHub-style continuous diff in the terminal. Scroll through every changed file in one stream.
- PR-style comments at the line, range, file, and review level. 
- Review tracking at file or hunk granularity, persisted across sessions.
- Three export targets: push a real review to GitHub or GitLab, copy structured markdown to your
  clipboard, or pipe to stdout.
- Works with git, jj, and mercurial. Reviews uncommitted changes, commit ranges, or any GitHub PR
  or GitLab MR.

## Quick start

```bash
tuicr                       # Pick from a commit selector
tuicr tui                   # Same TUI, explicit subcommand
tuicr -w                    # Uncommitted changes (skip selector)
tuicr -r main..HEAD         # Commit range
tuicr pr 125                # GitHub PR
tuicr mr 125                # GitLab MR
tuicr tui pr 125            # GitHub PR via explicit TUI subcommand
tuicr --stdout              # Pipe the review to stdout
tuicr review list           # List saved local review sessions
```

Inside tuicr, navigate with `j`/`k`, press `c` to comment, then `y` to copy the review or
`:submit` to push it to GitHub. When opening a GitHub PR or GitLab MR you've reviewed before,
tuicr preselects commits newer than your latest submitted review when that metadata is available;
commits already covered by that review are marked with `✓` in the inline selector.
Auto-detects git, jj, or mercurial.

## How it compares

| | tuicr | [hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk) | [lumen](https://github.com/jnsahaj/lumen) | `gh pr review` | `git diff` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| TUI diff viewer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Write comments in the TUI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Vim keybindings | ✅ | ❌ | partial¹ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Push inline review to GitHub | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | partial² | ❌ |
| Push inline review to GitLab | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Agent-ready markdown export | ✅ | via CLI skill | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| git | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| jj | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Mercurial (hg) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Single static binary | ✅ | (needs Node) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

¹ Lumen has `j`/`k` navigation but no broader vim model (visual mode, `{N}G`, `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u`,
etc.).

² `gh pr review` posts approve/comment/request-changes at the review level only. No inline line
comments.

## Export your review

When you're done reviewing, send your comments wherever the work continues.

### To GitHub

`:submit` opens a picker for Comment, Approve, Request changes, or Draft. Inline comments land
on the right lines as a real PR review. Review-level comments become the review summary.
Requires `gh` authenticated to the repo.

### To GitLab

`:submit` offers Comment, Approve, or Request changes on a GitLab MR. Inline comments post as
discussion notes. Review-level comments become the summary. Requires `glab` authenticated to the
host. Request changes needs your account to be an assigned reviewer. Only Draft is GitHub-only
here. See [docs/GITLAB.md](docs/GITLAB.md) for setup, self-hosted instances, and troubleshooting.

### To your coding agent

`y` or `:clip` copies a structured markdown block to your clipboard. Each comment has a number
and a file/line anchor: 

```markdown
I reviewed your code and have the following comments. Please address them.

1. `src/auth.rs` - Consider adding unit tests
2. `src/auth.rs:42` - Magic number should be a named constant
3. `src/auth.rs:50-55` - This block could be refactored
```

Paste it back to any coding agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc).

For an agent-driven workflow where your agent opens tuicr in a tmux split pane, see
[skills/tuicr/SKILL.md](skills/tuicr/SKILL.md).

### To stdout

Run with `--stdout` to pipe the markdown to another process:

```bash
tuicr --stdout > review.md
tuicr --stdout | pbcopy
```

## Review session CLI

`tuicr review` exposes saved sessions without opening the TUI. It can list
sessions, add comments, and print stored comments for agent and script
integrations. See [docs/REVIEW_CLI.md](docs/REVIEW_CLI.md).

The TUI creates a persisted session file when a review target becomes active,
so collaborative tools can add comments immediately. Empty auto-created session
files are removed when the TUI exits. `tuicr review list` marks currently open
TUI sessions with `"active": true`.

## Library API

tuicr also exposes a Rust library API for tools that want to build on top of its
persisted review sessions. `ReviewStore` can list sessions for a checkout, load a
session, and add review, file, line, or range comments using the same insertion
primitive as the TUI.

```rust
use tuicr::{AddCommentRequest, CommentTarget, CommentType, LineSide, ReviewStore};

let store = ReviewStore::new();
let sessions = store.list_sessions_for_repo("/path/to/repo")?;
let session = &sessions[0].session_ref;

store.add_comment(
    session,
    AddCommentRequest {
        target: CommentTarget::Line {
            path: "src/main.rs".into(),
            line: 42,
            side: LineSide::New,
        },
        content: "Handle the empty case here.".into(),
        comment_type: CommentType::from_id("issue"),
    },
)?;
```

## Configuration

Path: `~/.config/tuicr/config.toml` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\tuicr\config.toml` on Windows.

```toml
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"
diff_view = "side-by-side"   # or "unified"
ignore_whitespace = false    # ignore all whitespace in local VCS diffs
appearance = "system"        # or "dark" / "light"
mouse = true
leader = ";"                  # configurable prefix for leader shortcuts
comment_vim = false           # vim modal editing in the review comment box
review_watch_interval_ms = 1000 # set to 0 to disable persisted-review polling

[[comment_types]]
id = "issue"
color = "red"
definition = "must fix before merge"
```

Bundled themes: `dark`, `light`, `ayu-light`, `ayu-mirage`, `onedark`, `github-light`,
`github-dark`, `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-macchiato`,
`catppuccin-mocha`, `everforest-dark`, `everforest-light`, `gruvbox-dark`,
`gruvbox-light`, `nord-dark`, `nord-light`, `nord-dark-high-contrast`,
`nord-light-high-contrast`, `solarized-light`, `solarized-dark`, `tokyo-night-storm`,
`tokyo-night-day`.

Local themes: set `theme = "my-theme"` or run `tuicr --theme my-theme`, then create
`~/.config/tuicr/themes/my-theme.toml` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\tuicr\themes\my-theme.toml`
on Windows. Local themes may reference a local `syntax_theme = "my-syntax.tmTheme"` file for
syntax highlighting. A ready-to-copy example lives at [`examples/tuicr-teal.toml`](examples/tuicr-teal.toml)
with its matching [`examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme`](examples/tuicr-teal-syntax.tmTheme) syntax theme.

Full options, theme resolution precedence, `comment_types` semantics, and `.tuicrignore` rules in
[docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md).
